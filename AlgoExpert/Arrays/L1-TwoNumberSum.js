// Two Number Sum-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*
Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any order. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array.

Note that the target sum has to be obtained by summing two different integers in the array; you canâ€™t add a single integer to itself in order to obtain the target sum.

You can assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers summing up to the target sum. 
*/

// Solution 1
/*
This function uses a nested loop to find a pair of numbers in the array that add up to the target sum. It iterates over the array, and for each number, it iterates over the rest of the array. For each pair of numbers, it calculates their sum and checks if it's equal to the target sum. If it is, it adds the pair of numbers to the newArrayResult and returns it. If it's not, it continues to the next pair of numbers. If it goes through all pairs of numbers without finding a pair that adds up to the target sum, it returns an empty array.

          let sum2 = array[j];
          // Calculate the sum of the two numbers
          let result = sum1 + sum2;
          
          console.log("sum2:", sum2)
          console.log("result", result)

// If we've gone through the whole array and haven't found a pair of numbers that add up to the target sum, return an empty array

  // Solution 2 - using object
  /**
    This function uses an object to store the numbers in the array. It loops through the array, and for each number, it checks whether the difference between the target sum and that number is in the object. If it is, it means that we've found a pair of numbers that add up to the target sum, so we return them. If it isn't, we add that number to the object and continue iterating through the array.

// Solution 2

  // Initialize an empty object to store the numbers we've visited
  const nums = {};
  
  // Iterate over the array
  for (let num of array) {

}

 // Solution 3 - using pointers
/*
This function uses a two-pointer technique to find a pair of numbers in the array that add up to the target sum. It first sorts the array in ascending order, then it initializes two pointers: one at the start of the array, and one at the end. It calculates the sum of the numbers at the start and end pointers, and if the sum is equal to the target sum, it returns those two numbers. If the sum is less than the target sum, it moves the start pointer to the right. If the sum is greater than the target sum, it moves the end pointer to the left. It continues this process until it either finds a pair of numbers that add up to the target sum, or it has gone through the whole array without finding such a pair, in which case it returns an empty array.
 */

  // This function is used to sort numbers in ascending order

  // Initialize two pointers: one at the start of the array, and one at the end

  let endPointer = array.length - 1;

  // Continue until the start pointer is no longer less than the end pointer
  while (startPointer < endPointer) {
    // Calculate the sum of the numbers at the start and end pointers
    let currentSum = array[startPointer] + array[endPointer];

    // If the current sum is equal to the target sum, we've found our pair of numbers
    if (currentSum === targetSum) {
      console.log("return both sums");
      return [array[startPointer], array[endPointer]];
    }
    // If the current sum is less than the target sum, move the start pointer to the right
